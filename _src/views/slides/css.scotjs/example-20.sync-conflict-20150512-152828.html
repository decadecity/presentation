Some time later we get a request to change the error presentation on the login page.  We open up dev tools, we inspect the element and we can see it's got a class of `.error`.  We change the colour from `red` to `orange` and it all looks good.

However, because there was only one form on the login page what we didn't realise was that we've just changed all the errors across the site.  Next thing we know there's a P1 "blocking" bug assigned to us saying that all the errors on the site are broken.  We reduce the severity of the bug to "cosmetic" and take a look at what's going on.
