If you thought the cascade was bad then specificity can get you into even more trouble.

With the cascade the last rule in source order applies.  With specificity the <b>rule</b> with the greatest specificity <b>selector</b> applies.

Specificity is independent of source order but if you've got two rules with the same specificity then the cascade comes back into play and source order applies again.
