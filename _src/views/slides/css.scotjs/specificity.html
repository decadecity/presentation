If you thought the cascade was bad then specificity can get you into even more trouble.

With the cascade the last rule in source order applies.  With specificity the rule with the greatest specificity selector applies.

Specificity is independent of source order but if you've got two rules with the same specificity then the cascade comes back into play and source order applies again.
