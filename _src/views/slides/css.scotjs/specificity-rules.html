Working out the specificity of a selector can get a bit confusing but is actually logical.  The specificity of a selector is expressed in a four item matrix and the highest specificity in the lowest index wins.

>>>>

To build the matrix you break the selector down into its component parts and add them up. Looking at the table here we can see the specificity for each component.

<<<<<<< HEAD
 1. The global selector has no specificity - which makes sense, it's not specific: it applies to everything.

 2. Elements are the least specific, they are in the final column.
 3. Next up are classes.
 4. Followed by IDs.
 5. And finally we have inline styles.

Here's an example of how to apply this:

>>>>

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the first one the single ID in the second slot trumps the two classes in the third slot.
