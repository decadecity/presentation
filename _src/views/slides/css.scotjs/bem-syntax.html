BEM is how we get around the twin problem of a single name space and low specificity in CSS: we use a naming convention.

>>>>

We break our code into logical blocks which will often match modular components in our UI.  A block is the top level wrapping element of our module.

Because we're going to need to style different parts of our block and we want to keep the specificity low - so no nesting - we're going to use elements to refer to these individual parts.  The class name of an element will consist of the block name followed by a double underscore and then the element name.

Finally, we might need to have different variants of a block or element and for this we use a modifier which is prefixed with double hyphen.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

>>>>

<<<<<<< HEAD
All these selectors have a specificity of one class.
=======
With the double underscores and hyphens this can look odd at first but it does make a lot of sense in practice.
