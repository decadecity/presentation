OOCSS - or Object Orientated CSS - is a way of managing your CSS.  Whilst it might not technically be object orientated in the way you are used to from other languages it's a conceptually similar principle.

With OOCSS we try and extract small re-usable elements - or objects - from our visual design.  These objects should be really minimal so that we can combine them to form the basic UI elements of our sites.
