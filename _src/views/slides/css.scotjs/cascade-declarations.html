The cascade doesn't just apply to rules, it applies to declarations within rules as well.  We can see in these examples that in the second case the `margin-top` property won't take effect as it's being overridden by the `margin` property below it.

This is easier to manage than the rules cascade, especially if we're keeping the number of declarations in our rules to a minimum.  However, we can help ourselves out by choosing a convention for ordering our rules.  What we want to avoid is using an arbitrary sort order - such as alphabetical - or just stuffing declarations in at the end of the rule as we go along.
