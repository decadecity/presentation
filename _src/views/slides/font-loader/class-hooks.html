  <h1>Determine the class hooks</h1>
  <p><pre class="code"><code>&lt;html class="&hellip; wf-customfont-n4-active &hellip;"&gt;</code></pre></p>

Now everything is included and the font loader is running you can use dev tools to inspect the `<html>` element to see the class hooks that have been set.

In this case we can see that there is a class of `wf-customfont-n4-active` being set to show that our custom font is active.
