  <h1>Spend time on enhancements</h1>

  <aside class="notes" data-markdown>

So far we've been focussing on the baseline but that's not actually where you spend most of your time - most of your time will be spent working on the enhancements.

In this e-commerce example you'll be spending time working on better ways to showcase the product.  You're going to be making the checkout flow smoother and faster.  You can add in the upsells.

The point is that you're doing this on solid foundations.  We don't spend our time in the foundations of buildings - in fact when was the last time you even thought about the foundations of a building?

If you've got solid foundations you don't have to think about them, you can get on with the parts that people really notice.  If you're constantly having to go back and shoring up your foundations you've not got the time to make the rest of it great.
