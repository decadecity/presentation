This is the elephant in the room: let's fact it - everyone's using the latest version of Chrome these days and anyone who's not should have their internet access revoked.

In fact, anyone who's anyone is running Canary anyway so we know they've got all the latest experimental APIs available to them so, even if it's not a final spec we can still use them.

So cross browser compatibility's not an issue. So all that code that jQuery has to deal with browser bugs is just bloat because we're not bothering with any of that. Anyone who's seen me talk before will know that writing code that runs in any browser is for boring losers, right?
