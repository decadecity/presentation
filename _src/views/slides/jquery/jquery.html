jQuery, right? It's good for cross browser compatibility but it's massively bloated.

Modern browsers can natively do all the stuff jQuery does so why bother including it?

jQuery has taken away our ability to do the simplest thing in JavaScript, without including a bloated library.  It's made people lazy, they can't do anything without a jQuery plugin.
