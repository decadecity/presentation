There have been a number of studies into the impact of page performance.

To put these numbers in context, the average page load time is 8.7s.

A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/joshfraz/sept-2012rumtalk">study by Torbit</a> showed that by reducing the page load time from 6 seconds to 2 seconds reduced bounce rate by 10% and doubled the number of pages people visited.

there's one from Google and Microsoft that added artificial delays to their search engine pages which showed that adding a delay of just 200ms reduced engagement by 0.59%.
