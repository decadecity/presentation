            <h1>What do we mean by<br/><br/>"web page performance"?</h1>
            <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
Web page performance refers to how fast a page loads in a user's browser, how long it takes between clicking a link and the new page showing up on screen.

We're not talking about how the page reacts once loaded, whilst that is important it's a separate subject, delivering content is the focus here.
